## Reflection

Prompt | Response
--- | ---
Explain how you came up with the initial design of your ERD, based on the seed data and reading through the API endpoints | 
What would be the Big-O time complexity of your `/customers` & `/videos` endpoints? What does the time complexity depend on? Explain your reasoning. | 
What is the Big-O time complexity of the `POST /rentals/check-in` endpoint? What does the time complexity depend on? Explain your reasoning.  | 
Describe a specific set of positive and negative test cases you implemented for a model. | 
Describe a specific set of positive and negative test cases you implemented for a controller. | 
Broadly, describe how an API should respond when it handles a request with invalid/erroneous parameters. | It should display the correct status code and a message. |
Describe one of your custom model methods and why you chose to wrap that functionality into a method. | We had two custom methods, one of which is a check_out method that lives in the rental controller. This method is used to decrease the amount of inventory available and decirease the number of videos checked out any time a customer rents a video. This method was created in this specific controller because it made sense, but since we set up relations between rental and customers and rentals and videos, they too had access to these custom methods. |
